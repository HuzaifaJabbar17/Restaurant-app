 created a folder resto app 
  npx create-next-app@latest .

  created a repository in github --> Restaurant app

  after that paste this commands on terminal.
  
git remote add origin https://github.com/HuzaifaJabbar17/Restaurant-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

files is on gtihub after refreshing the webpage

in scr folder ---> app folder ----> created a restaurant folder ----> page.js

in nextjs routing is based on file system based routing

always used fragment for creating components
default will be always export default nameoftheFunction

go to localhost:3000/restaurant
it will serve you the page 

we can created different pages for login , signup 
but here we are doing on the same page and will render it on conditions because 
if more page is there it will take more time on rendering so the application get slow

now we have to create a folder of components so we creating a folder in app 
with name starting with underscore because we dont render it on the website 

src ----> app ------> _components ----> this folder will not be rendered & it is private and it will contain all components


erase the gloabal.css file content  ----> i.e to erase the default css

in app ----> go to page.js ---> erase everything inside the main tag and also the styling inserted in the main tag

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      
    </main>
  );
}

this page.js is the root page of our application 
whatever will be inside our main tag will be rendered on the root page of our application

now whatever will be shown in our ui that should contain this lina at the top of the file
'use client'

by default all the components in nextjs are server components so for frontend components we have to declare that it its client component

in a restaurant folder we are creating style file in it dedicated to the restaurant page
also import the styling file in page.js

A component shoul always start with capital letters
we did a mistake so we have to rectify it
